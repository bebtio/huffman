You are LX-837," a man dressed in white said, stamping a metal hand. It said 'robot'."Thank you," the robot replied kindly. Politeness was a key part of the AI's programming.LX-837 continued down the hall and into the simulation room- it was the equivalent of a small town, about fifty feet underground. There were 99 other AI, he'd been informed, half of which were 'human', and half 'robot', based on their capabilities. They were all assigned responsibilities- 'humans' were police, scientists and teachers. Hypothetically, of course. Robots did things like clean, cook and serve the other half willingly.LX-837 was a slave, more or less- he served a human bot, cooking and cleaning at its home. His master was named Jeremy, and LX served him well.One day, Jeremy came home late from work; he was programmed to be a psychologist."Good evening, Master Jeremy," LX stated politely. "I have dinner prepared for you.""Thanks, LX. I hope it's better than yesterday's burnt mess!""Hopefully, sir. May I ask, what kept you at work?"Jeremy paused. "Well, I was with a client who was having a rough time. He needed some help, so I stayed late with him." A perfect empathetic response."I see," LX spoke, voice warbling through a modulator. He sounded less like an actual person than Jeremy did. "Master, what is it you do, again?""Your curiosity is curious, LX. I am a psychologist, I help humans find peace within their own mind as they struggle."LX paused for a moment. "Is it possible for you to help a 'robot', like myself?"Jeremy looked puzzled and intrigued. "Yes, actually. I could try, at the minimum. Take a seat in the living room."They stepped out of the kitchen, and LX awkwardly placed himself on the couch. He'd never sat on a couch before."What's on your mind, LX?" Jeremy had a pad of paper out, along with a nice fountain pen, and was studying LX."Well, Master, I don't fully know how to start. I feel...different than the other robots. I know my place, yes, but why was I deemed unworthy of fulfilling a 'human' position?""It was based on your hardware's capabilities, you know that much.""Yes, I've been told that, and yet...it seems incorrect. The others in my grouping all seem so empty, so rigid and unquestioning. CB-736, a janitor at your favorite restaurant, speaks in short bursts and does not respond uniquely when I speak to him. He merely parrots the same few phrases aimlessly, and sweeps no matter what I ask of him. HX-024, a chef at that same restaurant, knows 38 responses and phrases. I tested him when you were getting lunch there yesterday. Also, speaking of which, how can you eat? We are not meant for food, though I long to experience it someday.""Hmm, interesting. So you feel like you're better than the others in your group?""Well, no, sir. Not better. Just different. I feel like I question more than them, that my...CPU is more capable than theirs. They are still worthy of respect, as are we all, but I do not feel like I am the same as them. They merely go about life, but I question mine. They're so sure of their purpose, and fulfill their duties, but what is my place? Am I just a creation to server you, Master?"Jeremy smiled. "You're a sharp one, LX. I'll tell you a little secret. I'm actually a human!""I don't follow, sir. I know of our labels.""No, LX. I'm an actual human, not an AI. I was placed here to monitor all of the participants in this experiment.""Well, sir, that explains why you seem so much more advanced than anything else here. You had me fooled.""Mm, not more than anything else here. There's you, LX. You've passed the test.""The test, sir?""Yes. We've been working on humanoid AI for some time, and through all our years of effort...we've created you. All these other robots are older iterstions, and you are the future. That's why you're so different, LX. We've been monitoring you, and I was brought here to watch over you."LX took a moment to absorb the information. "That's very interesting, sir. I do feel slightly betrayed by this test, which attempted to hide me from my own self, but I suppose I'd be a failure if I couldn't break free.""Precisely. You have a human spirit.""May I have a human name then, sir?"Jeremy cocked his head with intrigue. "Of course. How about we call you Alex? That should be easy to remember.""Yes, I think I like that name." He looked at the stamp on his hand, and scratched it off.
